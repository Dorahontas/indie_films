              <p style="text-align: justify;">Movie Title: Teach Us All | Year:2016 | Length:1hr 53m</p><br>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I5hE2Xm_dDQ"></iframe>
<br><p style="text-align:left;">American schools aren’t exactly performing well compared to global standard, a fact that concerns parents, researchers and educators alike. This episode of NOVA takes a hard look at the gaps between our educational system and those of other countries, as well as racial and class disparities that are causing challenges here at home.
  This documentary isn’t just doom and gloom, however. You’ll learn about the science of learning, the role of technology in the classroom and what we can do to turn the American education system around. Researchers and educators team up to envision a future of innovation and equality that provides the education our young minds deserve.</p>
              <br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">Movie Title: NOVA: School of the Future | Year: 2017 | Length: 1hr 20m</p><br>

<br><p style="text-align:left;">Part documentary and part social-justice campaign, Teach Us All revisits the violent resistance to the desegregation of Central High in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1957. Sixty years after a group of African American students (known as the Little Rock Nine) defied racism and hatred to attend an all-white school, Teach Us All takes us back to the city where it all began.
The modern-day Little Rock school district once again faces upheaval as it navigates a recent state takeover and wrestles with civil rights issues facing schools across the nation. Educational inequality is at the forefront of this compelling documentary, leaving viewers with the lesson that some history is less settled than many would like to believe.</p>
